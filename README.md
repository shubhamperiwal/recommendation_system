# Recommendation System
In this repository, I will be building a recommendation system using Collaborative Filtering

I will be working on the infamous Movie Lens dataset which contains over 100k rows of user-movie ratings.
In the end, I will predict the rating for a specified movie which a specified user hasn't seen yet.

I will be using 2 methods:
1. Using Surprise library
2. USing low-level python code

I'm open to advice and suggestions. Please feel free to create a pull request if you feel this repository can be improved or just drop me an email at shubhamperiwal98@gmail.com
